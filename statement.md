**Problem Statement:**



**Hotels manage thousands of consumable items daily, from toiletries and linens to food ingredients. Manual tracking of this inventory using paper logs or disconnected spreadsheets leads to operational inefficiencies, including:**

**1.Revenue Leakage: Due to unrecorded consumption or theft.**

**2.Operational Delays: Running out of critical stock (e.g., soap, fresh towels) negatively impacts guest experience.**

**3.Data Silos: Purchasing teams do not know what the Housekeeping team actually needs in real-time.**



**Scope of the Project:**

**The scope of this project is limited to the internal inventory control of a single hotel property. It covers the lifecycle of a product from purchase (entry) to issuance (exit). It does not cover room booking or guest management.**



**Target Users:**

* **Hotel Store Manager: Responsible for purchasing and maintaining stock levels.**
* **Department Heads: (e.g., Head Chef, Housekeeping Supervisor) who request items from the store.**
* **Hotel Administrator: Who oversees the overall efficiency and costs.**



**High-Level Features:**

* **Centralized Database: A single source of truth for all hotel assets.**
* **Transaction Logging: Immutable history of every item moved in or out.**
* **Supplier Management: Linking items to specific vendors for easier reordering.**
* **Alert System: Proactive notifications for low inventory.**
